<p>The objective of the game is to be the last empire remaining.</p>
<p>Before the round starts, each player thinks of a word and tells the moderator their word. The moderator will also add a few fake words of their choosing.</p>
<p>To start the round, the moderator shuffles the list of words and reads them out loud. It's the job of the players to try and remember all the words. The moderator then picks a random player to go first.</p>
<p>The moderator is not allowed to list the words again unless a majority votes to do so.</p>
<p>The player chooses another player and tries to guess their word. If they guess correctly, that player joins their empire and the moderator marks them as eliminated and they get another turn. If they guess incorrectly, the player that was asked takes a turn.</p>
<p>Players in an empire can work together, but only the original member of the empire can make a guess.</p>
<p>If there are multiple players in an empire and their word was guessed, everyone joins the empire that guessed them.</p>
<p>The game ends once there is only one empire remaining.</p>
